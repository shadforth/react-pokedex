# React PokÃ©dex

A PokÃ©dex built with React.

The goal of this project is to build on my knowledge of React, learn more about Progressive Web Applications, performance, accessibility, and SEO.

This is an extension on my previous [Vue PokÃ©dex](https://github.com/shadforth/vue-pokedex), where the goal was to understand and use a JavaScript framework.
